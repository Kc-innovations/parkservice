        </ul><br>
            <p>The project aims to balance environmental protection with socio-economic benefits, ensuring that the park remains a critical habitat while also supporting livelihoods.</p><br><br>

        <h4>WACN Co-Management Agreement, Kainji Lake National Park</h4>
        <p>Kainji Lake National Park, in Niger and Kwara States, is Nigeria's first national park, established in 1979. It spans 5,340 square kilometers and includes the Borgu and Zugurma Game Reserves. It is home to elephants, lions, antelopes, hippos, and rich birdlife.</p><br>
        <p>Project Details:</p>
        <p>Partnership: In October 2023, the West African Conservation Network (WACN) signed a 31-year renewable co-management agreement with the NNPS.</p><br>
        <ul>Key Components:
            <li>Strengthening park protection through better ranger training and infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Reintroducing key species (lions, elephants) to restore ecological balance.</li>
            <li>Using advanced technologies (drones, camera traps) for wildlife monitoring.</li>
            <li>Community outreach to reduce human-wildlife conflict and support sustainable livelihoods.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>Goal:
            <li>Double the population of large mammals by 2040.</li>
            <li>Improve the park’s ecological health and tourism potential.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>This is Nigeria's first public-private partnership model for park management, aiming to set a precedent for future conservation efforts.</p><br><br>

        <h4>Forest Restoration & Community Engagement, Okomu National Park </h4>
        <p>Okomu National Park is a protected tropical rainforest in Edo State, covering around 200 square kilometers. It’s one of the last remnants of the Nigerian lowland rainforest and is home to forest elephants, white-throated monkeys, buffalos, and various bird species.</p><br>
        <p>Project Details:</p>
        <p>Led by: Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) in collaboration with the NNPS.</p><br>
        <ul>Okomu National Park
            <li>Reforestation of degraded areas within the park.</li>
            <li>Strengthening anti-poaching patrols and surveillance.</li>
            <li>Community involvement programs that provide alternative livelihoods (e.g., agroforestry, eco-tourism guides).</li>
            <li>Environmental education programs targeting schools and local groups.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <ul>Expected Outcomes:
            <li>Restoration of critical habitats for endangered species.</li>
            <li>Reduction in deforestation and illegal logging.</li>
            <li>Increased community ownership of conservation efforts.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>The project aims to not only protect biodiversity but also ensure that local communities benefit directly from the park’s resources in a sustainable manner.</p><br><br>
        
        <h4>NNPS Green Bond-Funded Afforestation Projects</h4>
        <p>The Nigeria National Park Service (NNPS) has been actively involved in afforestation initiatives funded through the country's Green Bond Programme.  These efforts aim to combat desertification, restore degraded lands, and enhance biodiversity across Nigeria's national parks. </p><br>
        <p>Overview <br>
        Under the Green Bond Programme, the NNPS collaborated with agencies such as the Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN), the National Agency for the Great Green Wall (NAGGW), and the Federal Department of Forestry to implement afforestation projects.  These initiatives focused on reforesting degraded areas within national parks and adjacent reserves.</p><br>
        <p>Key Achievements</p>
        <p>Land Restoration: The federal government reported the successful afforestation of over 6 million hectares of land through the green bond project, involving multiple agencies including the NNPS.</p>
        <p>Seedling Distribution: Approximately 6.5 million seedlings were raised and distributed to state governments and institutions for planting, contributing to reforestation efforts.</p><br>
        <p>Challenges</p>
        <p>Despite these achievements, some projects faced implementation challenges.  Investigations revealed that certain afforestation projects did not meet their objectives due to factors such as inadequate planning and execution.</p>
        <p>Case Study: Old Oyo National Park</p>
        <p>One notable project involved the restoration of degraded areas in Old Oyo National Park.  The government allocated N30.4 million from the green bond initiative to plant 6,000 trees in the park.  However, reports indicated that only about 100 trees were found during inspections, highlighting issues in project execution.</p><br>
        <ul>Steps Toward Improvement
        <p>In response to these challenges, the NNPS has taken measures to enhance project implementation:</p>
        <li>Personnel Changes: Following reports of project shortcomings, the NNPS redeployed top officials to improve oversight and accountability.</li>
        <li>Enhanced Monitoring: Efforts are underway to strengthen monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure the success of future afforestation projects.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>These initiatives underscore the NNPS's commitment to environmental conservation through afforestation, while also highlighting the importance of effective project management and oversight.</p>
